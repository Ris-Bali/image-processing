This readme will be updated  after some cleanup of code stay tuned

## Gray-Scale Conversion 

### Three methods have been employed for conversion into gray-scale images . 

Lets convert the following image to grayscale :

#### 1) Average method for Conversion 

In this method we take the average value of the pixel values R,G,B to get the gray-scale pixel . 

grayscale = R+G+B/3

The result we get is as follows :
